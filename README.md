# Coqfmt

A command line tool to format your Coq source code.

## Installation

Clone this repository and build using `opam`. You need `dune`. This package is not available in the OPAM repository (yet).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/toku-sa-n/coqfmt
cd coqfmt
opam install .
```

## Usage

Just input your Coq code from stdin. Coqfmt will print the formatted code to stdout.

See `coqfmt --help` for more detail.
